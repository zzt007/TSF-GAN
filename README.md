# TSF-GAN
Temporal-Spectral feature Fusion GAN for multi vehicle trajectory prediction at signalized intersection

## Data Avaliability
This work uses the SIND dataset for training and evaluation. 

⚠️However, due to the limitation of the original dataset license, we are unable to distribute the complete dataset and the processing scripts directly in this repository. 

💡 We provide a simple example of processed data in the `tsf_gan/data/dataset_example/train` folder, a .csv file.

If you require the SIND dataset, please visit this website to obtain full authorization.
